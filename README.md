# My Website

This is a simple static website containing:
- `home.html`
- `about.html`
- `services.html`
- `contact.html`

Deployed with GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

## Deployment
A GitHub Actions workflow is included at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that publishes the site to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`.
